abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine individuals with disabilities' social and community participation in relation to their access to transportation. A self-administered online questionnaire was disseminated to individuals with disabilities throughout the United States. Individuals were found to use private vehicles less often and public transportation more often than previous studies have shown. Individuals with increasingly significant disabilities were more likely to face transportation-related exclusion. Almost half of the participants had to cancel an appointment because of a transportation-related conflict. The majority of participants felt that the level of access to transportation hindered their social life.},
