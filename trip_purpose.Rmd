## An important note when labeling variables. I joined persons with household twice (hhfaminc.x) from the first page to the second page...
## so maybe this creating and filtering data chunck on each page is unecessary.
```

```{r persons.data}
# Creating variables and filtering the persons population
nhts_persons <- nhts_persons %>%
  mutate(hhpersonid = paste(houseid, personid, sep = "-")) %>%
  filter(Ability != "NA",
         r_age >= 18 & r_age < 65,
         Income != "NA")
```

# How does travel differ between wheelchair users and the abled population considering trip purpose?

```{r trip.purpose, message=F, warning=F}
# This data will contain all trips (all households, persons, etc.)
new_trips <- nhts_trips %>% mutate(hhpersonid = paste(houseid, personid, sep = "-")) %>%
  filter(hhpersonid %in% nhts_persons$hhpersonid) %>%
  group_by(hhpersonid, trippurp) %>%
  tally() %>%
  mutate(n = ifelse(n > 10, 10, n))


# builds the grid
new_grid <- expand_grid(hhpersonid = unique(new_trips$hhpersonid), trippurp = unique(new_trips$trippurp)) %>%
  filter(trippurp != "-9")


# combine the grid and the trips
joined_grid_trips <- new_trips %>% right_join(new_grid) %>%
  mutate(n = ifelse(is.na(n), 0, n)) %>%
  left_join(nhts_persons, "hhpersonid") 

  # pipe into the histogram
  ggplot(joined_grid_trips, aes(x = n)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = stat(width*density), fill = Ability), binwidth = 0.8, colour = "black", size = .1, position = "dodge") +
    ggtitle("Comparing the number of trips by trip purpose and Income group", subtitle = "Comparison of Ability") +
    labs(x = "Number of Trips", y = "Percent of subgroup population") +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PuBuGn", direction = 1) + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size  = 10, 
                                     angle = 45,
                                     hjust = 1,
                                     vjust = 1)) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0:10)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format()) +
    facet_grid(Income ~ trippurp, scales = "free_x")
```

## Poisson Regression
It looks like "Ability" has no effect on trip purpose, instead, income may be what affects the number of trips by purpose the most.

```{r purpose.poisson}
joined_grid_trips$HBW <- ifelse(joined_grid_trips$trippurp == "HBW", TRUE, FALSE)
fit.hbw <- glm(HBW ~ Ability, Income, worker, family = "poisson", data = joined_grid_trips)
```
