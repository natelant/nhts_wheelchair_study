<h2>What percent of the U.S. population uses a wheelchair?</h2>
<p>This study compares the mobility of the abled population, the disabled population, and the population that uses wheelchairs. To make this comparison, I created a new variable called “Ability”, where each person is labelled “Abled”, “Disabled”, or “Wheelchair”.</p>
<p>In the 2017 NHTS, the respondents were asked if they have a medical condition or handicap that makes it difficult to travel outside of the home. If they responded yes, they were asked if they have had this condition for less than six months, more than six months or their whole life. The next follow-up question asked them to select all that apply from a list of medical devices they use. This list included a cane, walker, seeing eye-dog, crutches, motorized scooter, manual sheelchair, motorized wheelchair, or something else.</p>
<p>Those that responded disabled for more than six months or their whole life were labelled “Disabled”. Those that responded disabled (for more than six months or their whole life) and used a wheelchair (either manual or mechanical) were labelled “Wheelchair” (note the “Disabled” population does not include wheelchair users). The rest were labelled “Abled”.</p>

<h3>Age</h3>
<p>The age demographic of wheelchair users is obviously different from the able bodied population, according to the bar plot below. For this study, the population ages 18-64 will be considered. Perhaps in the future, more specific research could be done on the older population, where on-demand transportation could better serve the healthcare industry.</p>
